`docker-lock` is a cli tool that automates managing image digests by tracking
them in a separate Lockfile (think package-lock.json or Pipfile.lock). With
`docker-lock`, you can refer to images in Dockerfiles or 
docker-compose files by mutable tags (as in `python:3.6`) yet receive the same 
benefits as if you had specified immutable digests (as in `python:3.6@sha256:25a189a536ae4d7c77dd5d0929da73057b85555d6b6f8a66bfbcc1a7a7de094b`).

> Note: If you are unsure about the differences between tags and digests,
refer to this [quick summary](./docs/tutorials/tags-vs-digests.md).

`docker-lock` ships with 3 commands that take you from development 
to production:

* `docker lock generate` finds base images in your Dockerfiles and docker-compose
files and generates a Lockfile containing digests that correspond to their tags.
* `docker lock verify` lets you know if there are more recent digests 
than those last recorded in the Lockfile.
* `docker lock rewrite` rewrites Dockerfiles and docker-compose files 
to include digests.

`docker-lock` ships with support for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/),
[Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/),
[internal registries](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/),
and a variety of other registries. If your registry is not supported
out of the box, do not worry. `docker-lock` was designed to be
[easily extensible](./docs/tutorials/bring-your-own-registry.md) to any
container registry.

`docker-lock` is most commonly used as a
[cli-plugin](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/1534) for `docker` so `lock`
can be used as subcommand of `docker` as in `docker lock`. However,
`docker-lock` does not require `docker` at all. Instead, it can be called
manually as in `docker-lock lock`. This is especially convenient if the proper
version of `docker` is unavailable or you would prefer to use another
container technology such as [podman](https://podman.io/).

# Demo
Consider a project with a multi-stage build Dockerfile at its root:
```
FROM ubuntu AS base
# ...
FROM mperel/log:v1
# ...
FROM python:3.6
# ...
```
Running `docker lock generate` from the root queries each images' 
registry to produce a Lockfile, `docker-lock.json`.

Note that the Lockfile records image digests so you do not have to 
manually specify them.

Running `docker lock verify` ensures that the image digests are the 
same as those on the registry for the same tags.

![Verify Success GIF](./docs/assets/verify_success.gif)

Now, assume that a change to `mperel/log:v1` has been pushed to the registry.

Running `docker lock verify` shows that the image digest in the Lockfile 
is out-of-date because it differs from the newer image's digest on the registry.

![Verify Fail GIF](./docs/assets/verify_fail.gif)

While developing, it can be useful to generate a Lockfile, commit it to 
source control, and verify it periodically (for instance on PR merges). In 
this way, developers can be notified when images change, and if a bug related 
to a change in an image crops up, it will be easy to identify.

Finally, lets assume the Dockerfile is ready to be built and shared.

Running `docker lock rewrite` will add digests from the Lockfile 
to all of the images.

![Rewrite GIF](./docs/assets/rewrite.gif)

At this point, the Dockerfile will contain all of the digest information 
from the Lockfile, so it will always maintain the same, known behavior 
in the future.

# Install
`docker-lock` can be installed as a
[cli-plugin](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/1534) for `docker` or as a
standalone tool.

## Cli-plugin
Ensure `docker` cli version >= 19.03 is installed by running `docker --version`.

### Linux / Mac
* `mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins`
* `curl -fsSL https://github.com/safe-waters/docker-lock/releases/download/{VERSION}/docker-lock-{OS} -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-lock`
* `chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-lock`
### Windows
* Create the folder `%USERPROFILE%\.docker\cli-plugins`
* Download `docker-lock-windows.exe` from the releases page.
* Rename the file `docker-lock.exe`
* Move `docker-lock.exe` into `%USERPROFILE%\.docker\cli-plugins`

## Standalone tool
* Follow the same instructions as in the
[cli-plugin section](#cli-plugin) except place the `docker-lock` executable in
your `PATH`.
* To use `docker-lock`, replace any `docker` command such as `docker lock` with
the name of the executable, `docker-lock`, as in `docker-lock lock`.
